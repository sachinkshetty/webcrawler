1) The project has been built using Spring boot.
2) import the project as a maven project in any IDE
3) once the project has been build , please right click on the project in the ide and run as 'Spring Boot application'
4) I have used jsoup api to crawl the html site
5) some of the css selector are hard coded in the class itself as the element parsing is quite specific to the requirement
